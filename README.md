# Garden Plan
Gardening has long been regarded as a therapeutic and rewarding activity, offering individuals an opportunity to enhance their mental well-being and express creativity through the design of their personal spaces. However, the process of planning and designing a garden can often feel overwhelming, especially for those who lack experience or design expertise. Many aspiring gardeners find it challenging to arrange plants, rocks, grass, and other elements in a visually pleasing and cohesive way. Selecting the right elements and envisioning how they will fit together within a specific space can be time-consuming and intimidating, leading many people to abandon their landscape design ambitions before even starting.
